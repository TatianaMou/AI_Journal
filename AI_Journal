AI Usage Journal

Section 0201

Week 1:
I used ChatGPT to check the accuracy of my Python code for my homework assignment. I only used it when I was confused about something. Other than that, I did not use AI this week.

Week 2:
I did not use AI this week. I helped my dad take photos of himself so he could try out AI video generation, but overall, I did not use AI personally.

Week 3:
I did not use ChatGPT or AI this week.

Week 4:
I did not use ChatGPT or AI this week, but my group members used AI for our group project. Not to complete it, but to get a template and ideas for what we can use for functions.
